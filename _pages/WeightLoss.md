### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* D3
* Microsoft Excel
* pandas

## Data
Data created personally for personal use. Files available in respository. 

#### Explanation of Features
* Date
* Weight recorded
* Weight predicted through Excel FORECAST function
* Weight lost on that day, in pounds
* Average weight lost over range January 1, 2020 - Present
* Weight lost since the same day the previous week
* Rolling weekly average
* Day of the week
* Day of the week as numeric factor
* Volume of water consumed [1]
* Sodium Intake [2]
* Calorie Intake [3]
* Meal Frequency [4]
* Eat after 8 : 1 = Yes, 0 = No
* Eat after 11: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
* Hours of Sleep
* Hunger upon waking, before weigh in: 1 = Yes, 0 = No

## History, for those who care
My obesity has begun affecting my ability to live happy and healthy. It has prevented me from enjoying activities with my family like Roller Coasters, sports, and outdoor projects like scouting with my son and rebuilding my old muscle car. On the evening of December 9, 2019, my wife asked if I'd like to try the Keto diet with her starting the following morning and I said sure. After a 10 day bout with the worst keto flu I've ever heard of anyone having and aiming for zero carbs each day, I caved. On December 19th, I ate half an apple and felt amazing. Over the next 10 days I realized I needed at least a few carbs, but have kept my intake under 20g total per day, including fiber. With few cravings and no cheats, I aimed for 75% of my basal metabloic rate's necessary calories, initially about 1600 per day, and attempted to balance calories to about 70% fat, 30% protein and any discrepancies in the 20g of carbs I had left over. I felt so much better and felt the weight coming off, but I weighed more than my scale could accurately measure so on New Years Eve, December 31, 2019, I gorged on stuffed crust pizza, cheese sticks and garlic knots. This was to be my last meal as a fatty.

On January 1st, I began recording my weight. Over the next month, as my weight continually declined, I realized I was losing more weight than should be possible. I had been in ketoosis for 3 weeks prior to starting my records so this couldn't have been water weight as I had lost all of that (or most of it) during my Keto flu. Either the doctors are wrong about calories in versus calories out or I have super human metabolism. By early February, I began recording other features of what might be causing my rapid, consistent, easy weight loss. As of late March, I should have reached a plateau but I have not. I should have had at least some cravings or hunger, but again that has not been the case. The features included might help me and others understand better what truly has the most effect on weight loss as my journey so far defies what all documentation says I should have experienced. This project began with understanding why my diet is working so well, but might evolve into finding out how to make a diet work well for everyone.

My bacon, cheese, and mayonaise version of keto defies everything I've ever been told.
