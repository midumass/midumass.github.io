# SAD Dieting
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/midumass/SADieting/tree/master/) 

### Purpose
We have an epidemic on our hands in form of obesity. This epidemic began in the mid-1970â€™s and has spiraled out of control since. It has been claimed by countless nutrition specialists and health professionals that the cause is directly related to our eating sweets and fatty foods and the solution is to eat more vegetables, lean meats, and plant-based oils and nuts. Their claims are based mostly under the premise of preventing heart disease, a leading cause of death in most developed nations, while keeping us a healthy weight, but the western world has accomplished neither of those goals since this nutritional dogma has been put in place. What did the Standard American Diet look like in 1970, when obesity was non-existent, and what does it look like today? Are we really eating more of the foods that are claimed to cause these problems or could the nutritionists be wrong? This project looks at some relationships between how we eat now and how we ate before the obesity era.
