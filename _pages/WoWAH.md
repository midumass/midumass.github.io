# WoW AH Data Mining
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/midumass/DSC-540/tree/master/10.3) 

### Purpose
World of Warcraft offers more in-game information to the world via its API's than any system currently online. Everything from player stats and achievements to community information is available through different API calls to anyone willing to create a free account. These accounts are both limited per hour and throttled per second so they can take a while to complete if the dataset being built is large, but the result is incredible. Just pulling data from the player-created auctions from all the realms results in a dataset of over 12 million auctions. While many of these are duplicates from cross-server auctions, a clean dataset results in over 5 million observations.
